### (a) Definitions of Elasticity and Scalability in Cloud Computing for Deep Learning (10 points)

- **Elasticity** refers to the cloud's ability to automatically adjust computing resources based on demand. For deep learning, this means dynamically scaling GPUs, TPUs, or CPUs up or down depending on workload intensity, ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.

- **Scalability** is the ability of a cloud system to handle increasing workloads by adding more resources, either **vertically** (upgrading existing resources like more powerful GPUs) or **horizontally** (adding more instances). In deep learning, scalability ensures that large-scale training models can run efficiently across multiple nodes.

### (b) Comparison of AWS SageMaker, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio (10 points)
